# customer-segmentation-clustering
Unsupervised Machine learning project for customer segmentation using KMeans , Agglomerative Clustering, PCA and DBSCAN. Includes EDA, feature scaling, and interpretation of cluster characteristics for targeted marketing 


MALL Customer Segmentation 
This project applies clustering algorithms to segment mall customers based on their behavior and demographics. Techniques used include KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, PCA, DBSCAN, and evaluation With Sillhouette Score. 

##Dataset
- Source: Mall Customer Dataset
- Features: Age, Annual Income (k$), Spending Score (1â€“100)


##Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Anaconda Navigator(Spyder)

##Features 
- EDA with visualization
- Data Preprocessing & Feature scaling 
- Multiple clustering methods
- Silhouette score comparison
- Customer persona analysis

##Clustering Methods 
- KMeans
- Agglomerative Clustering
- DBSCAN
- PCA for dimensionality reduction

##Evaluation
 - Clustering Models are Evaluated using Silhouette Score for model selection and interpretation 

## Insights
- Identification of distinct customer person
- Recommendation for targated marketing strategies

- Identified 5 unique customer segments, such as:
Young Spenders
High-Income Conservative Spenders
Middle-Aged Average Spenders
Low-Income High Spenders
Older Low Spenders
- Enables data-driven marketing by tailoring strategies to customer profiles.
- Potential use in personalized offers, loyalty programs, and customer retention.
